# Vanilla JS Quiz Game

This quiz game presents a series of random questions retrieved from the Open Trivia Database API: https://opentdb.com/

This game was the final excercise for the "Javascript Fundamentals" class at HyperIsland. 

By developing this game I practiced DOM manipulation, calling an API, local storage for saving the scores, loops and arrays among others.
